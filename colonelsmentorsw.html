<p><h1>MENTORS</h1>
<p><b>Damian R. Jones</b>, Assistant Principal B.A., Oberlin College; M.A., DePaul University. He provides administrative support for Parker's involvement in robotics. He enjoys supporting opportunities for students to pursue their own interests through project-based activities like FIRST Robotics. He is pursuing continued graduate study in curriculum and instruction. Francis W. Parker since 2002.
<p><b>Xiao Zhang</b>, Co-Chair of Science Department, High School Science Teacher. B.A., Physics, University of Chicago. Mr. Zhang teaches Physics and has worked with FIRST Robotics teams at Parker and elsewhere from 2003. He has also worked with the Lemelson-MIT InvenTeam at Parker. Francis W. Parker since 1999.
<p><b>James Audrain</b>, Co-Chair of Science Department, received his BA from Macalester College in 1990 and his MAT at national Louis University in 1995. He has taught at Francis W. Parker School for twelve years, and previous to that in the Chicago Public Schools and an international school in Venezuela. Currently Mr. Audrain teaches Science in the Lower and Intermediate Schools.
<p><b>Anne Marie Fries</b>, Middle School Science Teacher B.A., Education with a minor in Science, National-Louis University; M.Ed., Science Education, National- Louis University. She has developed an engineering curriculum integrated with the math program into the 8th grade, teachs a Lego Robotics unit and assists with the FLL team and Science Olympiad. She has also taken a few workshops on Lego Robotics through the ICE Conferences. In addition to spending as much time as possible with her family, Mrs. Fries enjoys her role as an adjunct faculty member at National-Louis University, teaching courses in the Science Education Department. Francis W. Parker since 1976.
<p><b>George Austin</b>, High School Science Teacher.B.S., Engineering Physics, and B.A., Philosophy, University of Illinois; M.S., Education and Social Policy, Northwestern University. Mr. Austin teaches Physics and has worked with FIRST Robotics teams at Parker and elsewhere from 2003. He has also worked with the Lemelson-MIT InvenTeam at Parker. Francis W. Parker since 1997.
<p><b>Ray Llanes</b>, High School Computer Science Teacher. B.S., Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Prior to joining Francis W. Parker in 2006, Mr. Llanes was a tutor at New Trier High School and at Academic Tutoring Centers, working with students in math and ACT prep. Before a change in careers, Mr. Llanes worked at AmericanEagle.com as a web developer and at PharMedium Services as an IT specialist. For the past two years, Mr. Llanes has mentored a FIRST team in the programming area, and he enjoys seeing students engaged in the entire design process. Outside of school, Mr.Llanes plays hockey and is a huge Chicago sports fan.
<p><b>Adam Colestock</b>, Middle School Math and Science Enrichment Coordinator, B.A. in Mathematics from Williams College, currently pursuing a Ph.D. in the Learning Sciences at Northwestern University. Mr. Colestock coordinates a range of extracurricular clubs and activities for middle school students including Science Olympiad, Science Fair, Math Olympiad and more. He also enjoys working with Parker's middle school FLL program for which he served as mentor for 1 year and coach for the past 2 years. Though his graduate studies focused on mathematics education, Mr. Colestock has recently become most interested in exploring with his students the ways that design and engineering can be used to integrate science and mathematics through creative problem solving.
<p><b>Richard Ledford</b>, has invented, manufactured and marketed the first available consumer battery charger for N-cell size NiCd batteries. Founded Ledford Micro Support to market custom designed rechargeable battery systems, and then transitioned into custom built personal computers and networking. Programmed a large industrial robot for tasks associated with station transfer within a manufacturing cell containing a 15KW laser heat treating station and an industrial turning center. This included custom modifications to ROM-based robot firmware to upgrade performance of existing functions.
