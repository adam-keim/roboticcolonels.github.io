				<font size="5" color="dddddd">Richard Ledford</font>
				<p>has invented, manufactured and marketed the first available consumer battery charger for N-cell<br>size NiCd batteries. Founded Ledford Micro Support to market custom designed rechargeable<br>battery systems, and then transitioned into custom built personal computers and networking. Programmed a large industrial robot for tasks associated with station transfer within a manufacturing cell containing a 15KW laser heat treating station and an industrial turning<br>center. This included custom modifications to ROM-based robot firmware to upgrade performance<br>of existing functions.
